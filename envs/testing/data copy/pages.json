(error.code === 'RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND') {\n    console.log('User not found');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Python SDK\n\n**Installation**\n```bash\npip install platform-api-client\n```\n\n**Usage Example**\n```python\nfrom platform_api import PlatformClient\n\nclient = PlatformClient(\n    api_key='your_api_key',\n    environment='production'\n)\n\n# List projects\nprojects = client.projects.list(\n    status='active',\n    limit=25\n)\n\n# Create a task\ntask = client.tasks.create({\n    'title': 'New Task',\n    'project_id': 'proj_123',\n    'assignee_id': 'user_456',\n    'priority': 'high'\n})\n\n# Error handling\ntry:\n    user = client.users.get('invalid_id')\nexcept PlatformAPIError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e.code} - {e.message}\")\n```\n\n### Community Libraries\n\n**PHP**\n- `platform/api-client-php`: Official PHP client\n- `guzzlehttp/guzzle`: HTTP client for custom implementations\n\n**Ruby**\n- `platform-api-ruby`: Community-maintained Ruby gem\n- `faraday`: HTTP client for custom implementations\n\n**Go**\n- `platform/go-client`: Official Go client\n- `net/http`: Standard library for custom implementations\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\n**Pagination**\n- Always use pagination for list endpoints\n- Limit page size to reasonable numbers (≤100)\n- Use cursor-based pagination for large datasets\n- Cache results when appropriate\n\n**Field Selection**\n- Use the `include` parameter to fetch related data\n- Avoid over-fetching unnecessary data\n- Use sparse fieldsets when available\n- Consider GraphQL for complex data requirements\n\n**Caching**\n- Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed data\n- Use ETags for conditional requests\n- Respect cache headers in API responses\n- Implement cache invalidation strategies\n\n### Security Best Practices\n\n**API Key Management**\n- Store API keys securely (environment variables, key vaults)\n- Rotate API keys regularly\n- Use different keys for different environments\n- Monitor API key usage and access patterns\n\n**Data Protection**\n- Use HTTPS for all API communications\n- Validate and sanitize all input data\n- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information\n- Log security events and monitor for suspicious activity\n\n### Error Handling\n\n**Retry Logic**\n- Implement exponential backoff for retries\n- Retry only on appropriate HTTP status codes (5xx, 429)\n- Set maximum retry limits\n- Log retry attempts for monitoring\n\n**Graceful Degradation**\n- Handle API unavailability gracefully\n- Implement fallback mechanisms\n- Provide meaningful error messages to users\n- Monitor API health and performance\n\n## Support and Resources\n\n### Getting Help\n\n**Documentation**\n- API Reference:

teams on how to effectively implement and maintain our design system across all digital products and platforms.</p>\n\n<h2>Development Integration</h2>\n\n<h3>CSS Framework Integration</h3>\n\n<h4>Installation and Setup</h4>\n<p>Our design system is available as a comprehensive CSS framework that can be integrated into any web project:</p>\n\n<h5>NPM Installation</h5>\n<pre><code>npm install @company/design-system\n# or\nyarn add @company/design-system</code></pre>\n\n<h5>CDN Integration</h5>\n<pre><code>&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.company.com/design-system/v2.1.0/css/design-system.min.css\"&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"https://cdn.company.com/design-system/v2.1.0/js/design-system.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<h4>CSS Custom Properties</h4>\n<p>Our design system uses CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming:</p>\n\n<pre><code>:root {\n  /* Color tokens */\n  --color-primary: #2563EB;\n  --color-primary-hover: #1D4ED8;\n  --color-success: #10B981;\n  --color-warning: #F59E0B;\n  --color-error: #EF4444;\n  \n  /* Typography tokens */\n  --font-family-primary: 'Inter', sans-serif;\n  --font-family-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;\n  --font-size-base: 1rem;\n  --line-height-base: 1.6;\n  \n  /* Spacing tokens */\n  --spacing-xs: 0.25rem;\n  --spacing-sm: 0.5rem;\n  --spacing-md: 1rem;\n  --spacing-lg: 1.5rem;\n  --spacing-xl: 2rem;\n  \n  /* Border radius tokens */\n  --radius-sm: 0.25rem;\n  --radius-md: 0.5rem;\n  --radius-lg: 0.75rem;\n  \n  /* Shadow tokens */\n  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n}</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Component Library Integration</h3>\n\n<h4>React Components</h4>\n<p>Pre-built React components following our design system:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import { Button, Input, Card, Modal } from '@company/design-system-react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    &lt;Card className=\"p-6\"&gt;\n      &lt;h2

system is optimized for performance:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tree-shaking:</strong> Only include used components and utilities</li>\n<li><strong>Critical CSS:</strong> Inline critical styles for above-the-fold content</li>\n<li><strong>CSS Modules:</strong> Scoped styles to prevent conflicts</li>\n<li><strong>Compression:</strong> Minified and gzipped CSS files</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bundle Size Optimization</h3>\n<pre><code>// Import only what you need\nimport { Button, Input } from '@company/design-system-react';\n\n// Instead of importing everything\n// import * from '@company/design-system-react';</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Testing and Quality Assurance</h2>\n\n<h3>Visual Regression Testing</h3>\n<pre><code>// Example using Chromatic for visual testing\nimport { Button } from '@company/design-system-react';\n\nexport default {\n  title: 'Components/Button',\n  component: Button,\n};\n\nexport const Primary = () => &lt;Button variant=\"primary\"&gt;Primary

User Registration\n```javascript\nconst registerUser = async (userData) => {\n  const response = await fetch('/api/auth/register', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n      email: userData.email,\n      password: userData.password,\n      firstName: userData.firstName,\n      lastName: userData.lastName\n    })\n  });\n  \n  if (response.ok) {\n    const data = await response.json();\n    localStorage.setItem('token', data.token);\n    return data.user;\n  }\n  \n  throw new Error('Registration failed');\n};\n```\n\n#### 2. User Login\n```javascript\nconst loginUser = async (email, password) => {\n  const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({ email, password })\n  });\n  \n  if (response.ok) {\n    const data = await response.json();\n    localStorage.setItem('token', data.token);\n    localStorage.setItem('refreshToken', data.refreshToken);\n    return data;\n  }\n  \n  throw new Error('Login failed');\n};\n```\n\n#### 3. Token Refresh\n```javascript\nconst refreshToken = async () => {\n  const refreshToken = localStorage.getItem('refreshToken');\n  \n  const response = await fetch('/api/auth/refresh', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'Authorization': `Bearer ${refreshToken}`\n    }\n  });\n  \n  if (response.ok) {\n    const data = await response.json();\n    localStorage.setItem('token', data.token);\n    return data.token;\n  }\n  \n  // Redirect to login if refresh fails\n  window.location.href = '/login';\n};\n```\n\n### Data Fetching Patterns\n\n#### Custom Hook for API Calls\n```typescript\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\ninterface UseApiResult<T> {\n  data: T | null;\n  loading: boolean;\n  error: string | null;\n  refetch: () => void;\n}\n\nfunction useApi<T>(url: string): UseApiResult<T> {\n  const [data, setData] = useState<T | null>(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);\n\n  const fetchData = async () => {\n    try {\n      setLoading(true);\n      const token = localStorage.getItem('token');\n      \n      const response = await fetch(url, {\n        headers: {\n          'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,\n          'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n        }\n      });\n\n      if (!response.ok) {\n        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n      }\n\n      const result = await response.json();\n      setData(result);\n      setError(null);\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'An error occurred');\n    } finally {\n      setLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchData();\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error, refetch: fetchData };\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Frontend Testing\n\n#### Unit Tests with Jest and React Testing Library\n```typescript\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux';\nimport { store } from '../store';\nimport LoginForm from '../components/LoginForm';\n\ndescribe('LoginForm', () => {\n  const

correctly', () => {\n    renderWithProvider(<LoginForm />);\n    \n    expect(screen.getByLabelText(/email/i)).toBeInTheDocument();\n    expect(screen.getByLabelText(/password/i)).toBeInTheDocument();\n    expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /login/i })).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n\n  test('submits form with valid data', async () => {\n    const mockSubmit = jest.fn();\n    renderWithProvider(<LoginForm onSubmit={mockSubmit} />);\n    \n    fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText(/email/i), {\n      target: { value: 'test@example.com' }\n    });\n    \n    fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText(/password/i), {\n      target: { value: 'password123' }\n    });\n    \n    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', {

 password: 'password123',\n        firstName: 'John',\n        lastName: 'Doe'\n      };\n\n      const response = await request(app)\n        .post('/api/auth/register')\n        .send(userData)\n        .expect(201);\n\n      expect(response.body.user.email).toBe(userData.email);\n      expect(response.body.token).toBeDefined();\n      expect(response.body.user.password).toBeUndefined();\n    });\n\n    test('should not register user with invalid email', async () => {\n      const userData = {\n        email: 'invalid-email',\n        password: 'password123',\n        firstName: 'John',\n
