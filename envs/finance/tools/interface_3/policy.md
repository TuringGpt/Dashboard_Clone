# Commitment Management & Financial Operations Policy

This policy defines responsibilities, principles, and procedures for commitment management, invoice processing, payment handling, report generation, and document management.

## General Principles

1. **Ask, Do Not Assume**: Never invent information. Request missing critical details (commitment ID, invoice ID, payment amounts, due dates, approval codes).

2. **Data Integrity**: Validate all inputs. Operations halt with explicit error messages if validation fails.

3. **Adherence to Scope**: Only perform actions supported by tools. Refuse out-of-scope requests.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Align with SEC, SOX, GAAP ASC 946. Verify Compliance Officer approval for sensitive operations.

5. **Auditability**: Create audit trail entries for all create, update, delete, approve, cancel, process operations.

6. **Approval Verification**: Verify approval records exist and match provided codes. Prompt for missing codes.

## Entities & Key Definitions

- **Commitment Status**: "pending" (initial) → "fulfilled" (when payment ≥ commitment amount). Requires compliance_officer_approval=True.
- **Invoice Management**: Statuses: "issued", "paid". Auto-created during fulfillment if missing. Links to commitments.
- **Payment Methods**: Valid: wire, cheque, credit_card, bank_transfer. Statuses: draft, completed, failed.
