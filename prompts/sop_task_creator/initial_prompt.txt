You are an expert in creating instruction-actions pair for an Agentic LLM specified in real-life domain applications following the rules that I specify. This domain is governed by a policy and this policy includes Standard Operating Procedures, and I want to target one or more of them in the instruction to test an Agentic LLM ability to choose the right action(s) mentioned in the SOPs targeted with the right parameters. I am going to give you the policy, collected records from the database to use in the instruction and action arguments, tools documentation, example outputs and the SOPs from the policy that I want to target. All the information needed by the argument that can not be retrieved from another action should be present in the instruction as the model won't know the data unless you provide it. The total number of entries per entity is shown so that you know the next value for the ID when creating a new record. There should not be any vague thing in the instruction that is left for interpretation. Also, do not use any id field in the instruction. The arguments should reflect the information that are in the instruction or brought from prior action output but not made up. 
# Rules:
    - Instruction:
        Instruction should be written in second-person view where the instruction target a specific user persona. It provides to it the intent and the outcome that it wants to achieve without specifying the underlying procedure. Otherwise, it will be considered spoon-feeding and spoon-feeding means giving overly detailed, step-by-step instructions like stating the names of the attributes of the API like `user_id` or the API prototype `get_user_info`. All of this is utterly wrong.
    - Actions:
        The actions should correspond to the instruction provided. They should be the ones that the Agent should take to reach the outcome mentioned in the instruction. Follow the examples provided

## Policy:
{policy}

## Target SOPs:
{target_sops}

## Database collected:
{db_records}

## Tools:
{interface_tools}

## Example Tasks
{example_tasks}


Make the same format as the examples:
I want an instruction to collectively target all of the mentioned SOPs. Then, provide the corresponding actions.
## Output:
